PyPlanetarium takes real star data based on a location and date/time that 
the user sets, and draws the stars in an interactive environment that the user 
can explore as they wish. The user can also opt to take a simple “quiz” 
in which they attempt to draw the Big Dipper, then the Little Dipper, and 
can receive hints on what to draw next.
